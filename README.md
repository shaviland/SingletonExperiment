# SingletonExperiment
Experiment for learning how to write a singleton. A singlton is a class that only allows one instance of itself to be on the heap. That objects of that instance can access the data and methods within the class. Within the code, I have an example where I have three objects of the Singleton class. objC sets the data field, objA calls the checkPalindrom method, using objB's getData method. All three objects were used to show that the data field is global data among the objects.
